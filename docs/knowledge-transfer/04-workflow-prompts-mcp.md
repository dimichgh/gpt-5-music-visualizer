## Workflow Prompts & MCP

Currently not applicable. If future workflow automation or MCP tools are added, document prompt templates and tool permissions here.

Suggested outline for future use:
- Prompt templates per workflow and target outcome.
- MCP tool permissions and safety constraints.
- GitHub App/Webhook integration if CI automation for encoding or packaging is introduced.
